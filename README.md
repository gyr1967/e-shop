# e-shop
E-shop site using react, express and mongodb

I followed the Code Step By Step series on this stack of technologies, and I have used my own CSS styling (unfortunately), and added some functionality like password hashing and salting, and input validation.

Still a work-in-progress, as the profile page hasn't been started on.

To get this running, first  do 
* %npm install  in /backend /frontend and the root directory
* in /backend do %nodemon
* in /frontend do %npm start
* voila!
